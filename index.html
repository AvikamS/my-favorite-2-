      <p> I like to code, because it let's you create apps and websites you want that dont exist to be made by yourself! It also brings out your creativity. Coding is fun, many jobs want software developers,etc. Coding also can help you orginize big files really quickly. So coding is fun, and comes in handy in MANY different ways!</p>
